115	SPLASH
	- https://github.com/DanielLarsenNZ/Hacking-on-Azure

115	INTRO
	- Hi, today I'm going to talk about Code and specifically exploring, designing and discovering Code.
	- (This is not a security talk)
	- My year of discovery:
		- TechEd 2013: TechEd 2013 was the year I discovered Azure
		- Azure
		- Hacking for fun and profit
			- Work is "imperative", so much of it is about the "how"
			- Hacking is more "declarative", it's about "what" and "what is possible"
		- GitHub
		- HACKAKL
		- OSS
			- Phoenix, piloted by Dr Zefram Cochrane in 2063, as portrayed in the excellent documentary "Star Trek: First Contact"
			- Who would be happy if that "movie" turned out to be a documentary?
				- Captain Jean-Luc Picard and the crew of the USS Enterprise time-travelled 300+ years (to 1996)
			- To me, this is what OSS and Hacking is all about.
